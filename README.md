I am a computer enthusiast based in Spain.
Love breaking stuff apart and seeing how everything works, that's why I would say I relate a lot to the quote bellow:

> I wanted to be an engineer, but security got in my way.

Mainly do programming in python, but I have projects with a wide variety of frameworks and languages.  

If you are interested in my projects you can read the blog posts with the #projects tag or go to my github page at [github.com/memoriasIT](http://www.github.com/memoriasIT)

I also produce videos in Spanish as tutorials which are computer related, you can check my channel here:

Finally if you ever want to contact with me you can find me at twitter [@MemoriasIT](http://www.twitter.com/memoriasit)
